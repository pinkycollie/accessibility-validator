Let’s customize that README to match your vision for Pinksync — a FastAPI + Next.js 14 hybrid designed for Deaf-first APIs, VR4Deaf, job and business flows, and your future PinkSync AI system.

README.md – Pinksync Starter Kit

# Pinksync Starter

**Deaf-first. AI-powered. Future-ready.**

This is a hybrid **Next.js 14 + FastAPI** starter built for real-time vocational, entrepreneurial, and rehabilitation workflows. Created by [Pinky Collie](https://mbtquniverse.com), this stack is built to support:

- Deaf-first API integration
- Vocational Rehabilitation (VR4Deaf)
- Job & Business development pipelines
- AI automation with scalable backend support

---

## How It Works

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (served under `/api/py`)
- **Vercel Production:** FastAPI runs as Python serverless functions alongside your React app.
- **Local Development:** FastAPI runs on `127.0.0.1:8000`, proxied via `next.config.js` rewrites.
