# Developer‑Magician  
### AI‑Native Accessibility Engine for Deaf‑First, ASL‑Centric UX

Developer‑Magician is a next‑generation developer tool that validates interfaces for true Deaf‑first accessibility.  
Not just WCAG. Not just checklists.  
This is accessibility built for sign‑language‑native users.

Developer‑Magician analyzes interfaces through an event‑driven, schema‑validated pipeline to ensure:

- ASL‑centric interaction flow  
- visual‑first navigation patterns  
- zero audio‑only traps  
- sign‑language‑native UX  
- accessible authentication and onboarding  
- context‑aware accessibility scoring  

It is part of the **360 Magicians** ecosystem inside PinkSync — a suite of AI‑native developer agents designed to modernize how software is built, validated, and deployed.
